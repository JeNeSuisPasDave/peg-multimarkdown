Notes for myself while pulling together the remaining lose ends in MultiMarkdown standalone for Mac.

? Performance tests - compare with a very large markdown file vs. e.g. multimarkdown based on GLib.

? Garbage output e.g. when processing unicode within tags:
	<p>‚Üê</p>

? Fix short options parsing in markdown.c
